## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

## Live Tracking (Beta)

Your mobile app can send real-time GPS points to visualize a moving path on the website.

- Create a track (auth required): POST `/live-tracks`
	- Response: `{ publicId, writeKey, ingestUrl, pollUrl, mapUrl }`
- Push points: POST `/live-tracks/{publicId}/points`
	- Headers: `X-Track-Key: <writeKey>`
	- Body JSON: `{ lat, lng, accuracy?, speed?, bearing?, t? }`
- Public map: GET `/live-tracks/{publicId}`
- Poll points: GET `/live-tracks/{publicId}/points?since=<ISO8601>`

Ending a track

- End explicitly: POST `/live-tracks/{publicId}/end`
	- Headers: `X-Track-Key: <writeKey>`
	- Effect: sets `is_active=false`, `ended_at=now()`.

Active vs idle

- The API returns `track.isActive` as an effective state: it is true only if `is_active=true`, `ended_at` is null, and the last received point is within the last 5 minutes. Otherwise the track is treated as idle/inactive for the UI even if not explicitly ended.

## Mobile API Auth (Sanctum)

- Login: POST `/api/login` with `{ email, password, device_name? }` â†’ `{ token, user }`
- Logout: POST `/api/logout` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- Current user: GET `/api/user` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

Protected endpoints (require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`):

- POST `/api/live-tracks` (create a track; associates to current user)
- POST `/api/live-tracks/{publicId}/points` (ingest point; also requires `X-Track-Key` header)
- POST `/api/live-tracks/{publicId}/end` (end track; also requires `X-Track-Key` header)
